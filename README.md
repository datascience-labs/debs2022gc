# DEBS 2022 Grand Challenge 
This github page contributes to DEBS 2022 Grand Challenge. 

## description
We participate in the DEBS GC 2022 as team Group-4.

The 2022 DEBS Grand Challenge focuses on real-time complex event processing of high-volume financial data. The goal of this challenge is to efficiently compute to EMA(Exponential Moving Average) as a trend technical indicator and to detect cross patterns that helps decisions on buying or selling on financial markets.

To meet their requirements, our solution finds the query1 answers that calculate both EMA38 and EMA100 per symbol. Besides, our solution handles the query2 answer that finds the intersactions of both EMA38 and EMA100 per symbol. 

We share the video where we explain our source code to Youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dOlg4LXdGI

```
  # buid the docker image and deploy our pyspark environment/its dependencies rapidly to your system
  docker build -t pyspark:latest ./
```
3. set up your token key
4. run the debs_2022_gc.py with docker container as the following command:
